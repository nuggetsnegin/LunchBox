## My Lunch Box - CSCI3172 Final semester group project testing PHP knowledge
Re-designed an existing application, http://www.tinyfeast.ca/. Tiny feast is used to deliver fresh lunches to school students. A code representing the school is required to get into the website. The site is only open from the 15th to the 22nd of every month. It also uses a unique ordering menu that does not follow any modern website. Our project, My Lunch Box attempts to tackle these issues and provide a better experience for users. Unlike tiny feast, which is only available for elementary students, our application is open to any educational institute and students of all ages. It is targeted towards busy parents who do not have the time to make lunches for their children, or do not want to spend a lot of time choosing. Our solution, My Lunch Box, allows them to order fresh easy to select lunchboxes from a premade menu. 

### Scope:
+ A user registration page.

+ A user login page.

+ Once logged in, the user can update their personal information and also view their order history, which includes all the lunch boxes they have ever purchased in the past.

+ Web visitors are able to browse the website without having to log in, but do not have access to the menu, checkout, order history or profile options.

+ Cookies and sessions are used to display a success page upon registration, login, checkout, sign out, update profile and disable account options.

+ Providing customers with a service - purchasing lunch boxes to be delivered to schools

+ Our website also provides the following options to users:
An online shopping cart with the option to add/delete boxes.

+ Ability to update user profile (name, email, password, address) and the ability to disable the account.

+ Our project successfully passes W3C validation, both HTML5 and CSS3.

+ It supports a variety of current browsers and operating systems, such as IE8+, Opera 30+, Firefox 40+, Chrome 44+, Safari 9+, MS Edge, Linux, Mac and Windows.
